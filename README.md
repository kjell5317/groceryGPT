# groceryGPT

GroceryGPT is a shopping list based on socket.io and Google Gemini, that allows you to create and manage your grocery lists in real-time. It uses the power of Google Gemini to provide intelligent categories to your grocery items, making it easier to organize and find what you need. Like payed competitors, it shifts bought items to a stock section.
